throw "\nHey there, it looks like you're trying to import the danger module. Turns out\nthat the code you write in a Dangerfile.js is actually a bit of a sneaky hack.\n\nWhen running Danger, the import or require for Danger is removed before the code\nis evaluated. Instead all of the imports are added to the global runtime, so if\nyou are importing Danger to use one of it's functions - you should instead just\nuse the global object for the root DSL elements.\n\nThere is a thread for discussion here:\n  - https://github.com/danger/danger-js/discussions/1153#discussioncomment-10981472\n";
